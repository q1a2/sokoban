# Sokoban

Took me about **3 hours** to add the last touches to the assignment (authentication, login/logout, cookies to stay logged in).

If you are unfamiliar with Sokoban puzzles, they are orginially from a japanese videogame ("Sokoban" literally means "warehouse man"). Usually, they involve getting a number of boxes into certain spots where they belong. In my version, the goal is to reach an end, with boxes being used as obstacles and ways to fill holes.

Very proud of how this project has shaped out. Really fun to make something like this.
